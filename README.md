<h2>Principles</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Save your creativity flow.</strong> SAMM avoid you wasting your time dealing with hundred of samples inside many nested directories. Just ask.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve your creativity with randomness.</strong> SAMM does not care about how you organize your samples. MPL selects samples randomly based on simple human-readable queries. (It will be funny to find some old-but-good samples or weird samples which you would have never chosen).</li>
    <li><strong>Easy, fast and light interface to avoid CPU and RAM wastefulness</strong>. Don't be afraid about the command line and let's save CPU and RAM for the DAW.</li>
