PRINCIPLES + LONG TERM GOALS
- decoupling
- test
- singleton object
- no more globals => require everywhere (clearer dependencies, remove globals.js)
- use await instead of 'sync' functions
- black-box with STATEFUL API (in order to have as few as possible work in the caller)
- each file should declare the usage or use process.env at the beginning (for clarity)


APP TESTING
- declare and fill process.env variables


SHORT
- check PathInfo.size
- manage test files
    - remove and generate files when it is needed
    - look for unix urls and explicit path.sep
    - be sure test files are git-ignored


MID
- bookmarks manager (add, remove, list, save)


LONG

- make NPM packages
- replace vorpal (not updated) with yarn
- E2E tests for CLI apps
